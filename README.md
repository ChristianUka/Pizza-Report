# Pizza-Report

## Project overview: 
The aim of this project  is to increase revenue by using smart data strategies. Iâ€™m diving into this mission with skill and accuracy, aiming to bring out the best in the numbers. The future we're aiming for is one where data isn't just facts but the key to success in how to operate, sell, create products, and earn revenue.

## Exploratory data analysis
Here I explore the sales data to answer the following questions:
1. what is the overall monthly and weekly sales trend.
2. which products are top seller.
3. which month or day should be targeted for marketing efforts.
4. What are the peak sales period.
5. Which product and size generate the highest revenue.
6. Which category gives the highst revenue.

## Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- For the year under review, Canada pizza have four (4) pizza categories with five (5) different sizes and thirty two (32) pizza types, 21,000 orders were placed with over 50,000 pizzas sold in their different store fronts, with revenue generated of $818,000.
- Classic Deluxe is the best-selling pizza in terms of quantity with over 2450 sold and accounted for 20.28% of Total Quantity sold.
- Total revenue by size, The Large size contributed the highest revenue with over $375,000 which makes 46% of the total revenue .
- Total revenue by category, Classic had the highest Total Revenue at 220,053.10, followed by Supreme, Chicken, and Veggie.
- Order daily trend shows that Friday had the highest quantity of pizza sold with a value of 8242, and 36.57% higher than Sunday, which had the lowest quantity sold. We can attribute this to the fact that people are in the mood for TGIF, reason why much quantities are sold on Friday. Based on this insight the company should allocate more staff strength for Fridays and reduce staff strength for other days like Sundays were we have lower quantities sold in order to cut cost.
- Revenue by weekday shows Friday also accounted for the highest Total Revenue With a value of over $136,073.90.
- Revenue by month shows that July had the highest Revenue with a value of $72,557.90 and was 13.32% higher than October, which had the lowest Revenue at 64,027.60. This insight shows that the company generate more revenue during the summer period and as a result they must ensure that they leverage on this to optimize their marketing campaigns
